Useful for folks that write long-form content containing subheaders, this will add an ID tag to any header tag in your content for deep linking.

== Description ==

A rather simple plugin, but tremendously useful for folks that like to write longer blog posts to be shared.  This will add an ID to each header tag in your content, but only if it doesn't already have an ID.  This will let your users deep-link to specific sections within your content.

It will also append a link with the content of `#` to each header that it adds an ID to.  The link has a class of `deep-link` though, so it's easy to hide if you prefer.  A future release may add an option in to Settings > Reading to hide this link.
